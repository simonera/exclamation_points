# Use of exclamation point in the tweets of selected politicians

Was it me, or did Trump tweet a lot of exclamation points? In this project, I try to answer this question. I used rtweet to scrape a few thousand tweets from the Twitter handle of 10 politicians, then I used ggplot to visualize the result. [Click here to see the project](https://sites.google.com/view/simone-rambotti/portfolio/exclamation_points). It includes:

- `exclamation_point.R`: R script
- `exclamation_point.Rmd`: R markdown
- `exclamation_points.png`: the resulting plot (see below)
